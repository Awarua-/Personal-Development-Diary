Started by reading the book Site Reliability Engineering, How Google runs production systems.

Key takeaways
Learn't about the different systems at a high level used at Google, of particular interest is Borg, a distributed cluster system. Its predessor is Kubernetes, I should look into this technology further.

Managed to get through the preface of the book and chapter one and two, which talks about what SRE is and how SRE works at Google and Google's systems.
